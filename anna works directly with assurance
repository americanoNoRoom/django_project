Question for Ovi 
1) Tell me about yourself, I see that you recently were promoted from senior to management. Congratulations

2) We will be small knit, so collaboration and communication seem like they will be key to the success of the department. 

3) How established are the knowledge articles? SOPs

4) What KPIs will I be measured at? What is important for the IT analyst to be measured at here? 

5) What are the top two types of tickets the IT department gets? 

6) How would you describe the culture at Assurance?

7) What is the IT departments relationship with the rest of the company? 

8) Ovi, can you explain your role to me? what was your role like as a senior engineer.


9) As I am being onboarded, aside from imaging and deployment of assets, what other types of work will I be assigned or will this be a position where I will have some liberty to take on some projects of my own?
